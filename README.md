# IoT_ML_Project

For this project, it is planned to use devices which are capable of digitizing signals in order to generate detection and control routines, so when one of the factors occurs, it can launch indicators which will notify an end user and thus to have a stable control over these situations and also that they react automatically to problems without the need for intervention.

### Methodology to solve it

The project is divided into several phases which are constantly repeated:

* Theoretical research on the possible solution and the problem
* Application design
* Programming to solve the problem
* Testing
* Analysis of the captured results (feedback)

### Algorithms 

#### SVM
Algorithm that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

#### WKNN
Using a modified basic classification algorithm of Machine Learning for pattern recognition and predict based on a numeric predictor variables.

#### Random Forest
Algorithm for classification, regression, etc. that constructs decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees
